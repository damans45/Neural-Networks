Neural Network from scratch using python to classify handwritten digits

In this section, I will create a neural network to classify images of hand written digits.

1. In the first model, we will create a binary classifier to identify the digit 0 vs all. So if the digit is zero, we will predict 1 otherwise 0
2. In the second model, we will use this binary classifier and add a hidden layer with 64 units to see the performance
3. In the final model, we will use softmax function for multiclass classification to identify all the digits from 0 - 9
